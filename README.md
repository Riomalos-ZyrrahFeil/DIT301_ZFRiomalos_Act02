## Reflection

### App Lifecycle
When switching between screens (MainActivity â†’ SecondActivity), I noticed that the **current activity pauses or stops**, and the new one becomes active.

### Activity Management
I learned that:
- Each screen in Android is an **Activity**.
- Activities connect with their XML layouts.
- To move between activities, we use an **Intent**.
- Android manages activities like a **stack** (the last opened activity is on top).
